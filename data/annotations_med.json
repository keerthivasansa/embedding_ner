After noticing some congestion, she proceeded with an otoscopy to examine the patient's ear canal for any signs of infection or blockage. Following these initial checks, an electrocardiogram (ECG) was ordered to monitor the patient's heart rhythm due to complaints of chest discomfort. When a lump was detected during a routine check-up, the physician recommended a biopsy to determine whether the tissue was cancerous. The patient was also referred for a CT scan to get a detailed image of the internal organs, which revealed an abnormal mass. Concerned by the findings, the doctor scheduled an MRI to obtain more precise images of the area in question. Given the patient's low hemoglobin levels, a transfusion was administered to restore the proper blood volume. Later, the patient underwent a colonoscopy to screen for colorectal cancer, especially since they had a family history of the disease. A bronchoscopy was also performed when the patient developed a persistent cough, allowing the physician to examine the lungs and airways for blockages or growths. For gastrointestinal symptoms, an endoscopy was used to explore the esophagus and stomach, where the doctor found and treated a small ulcer.\r",{"entities":[[21,33,"PROCEDURE / TESTS"],[181,189,"PROCEDURE / TESTS"],[300,317,"PROCEDURE / TESTS"],[493,499,"PROCEDURE / TESTS"],[583,585,"PROCEDURE / TESTS"],[723,726,"PROCEDURE / TESTS"],[827,838,"PROCEDURE / TESTS"],[1029,1041,"PROCEDURE / TESTS"]]}],["\r",{"entities":[]}],["In an emergency situation, the patient required a craniotomy to relieve the pressure caused by swelling in the brain after a head injury.

After significant blood loss during a surgery, another transfusion was given to stabilize the patient. Following symptoms of rectal bleeding, a second colonoscopy was performed to check for any recurrence of polyps. The patient's lung issues were examined again with a bronchoscopy, and inflammation was detected in the lower airways.
